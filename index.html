		<h2>ABOUT DOYIN</h2>
		<p>Azeezat was a very good and jovial friend. She cared so much about others. She was humble and didn't feel like she was better or experienced than others; she was ready to learn from others. I sure miss her and the memories we shared back at MASS tutorial. Though the time spent was a bit short, it is one I won't forget. Rest on, sis. We love you.


			Doyin was a rare and unique person. Once you meet her, you never forget her. Adedoyin aka Vibe queen.
			
			Doyin was completely loyal to her friends. She had a heart that cared completely. 
			
			She’s one of those gems everyone needs in their corner! Very real and smart. A few will remember her as a scholar
			
			When it came to studying just leave it for Doyin cause she never got tired of studying, she wanted to become a Doctor so bad.
			
			To Doyin it was all about achieving goals and making a better world for her family and friends. She loved seeing everybody happy but still struggled to make her self happy. She was Rihanna’s biggest fan and Kizz Daniel’s side chick, she never for once got tired of posting them.
			
			When it’s comes to fine locations, leave it for Doyin. She enjoyed going out and taking cute pictures ones she would end up not posting. 
			She never for once backstabbed her friends. She was indeed a good friend.

					She gave me the courage to face unpleasant situations and the strength to fight another day, she was indeed a good friend. I still wish I could bring her back to life.
					She badly wanted to become a medical doctor. She starved herself so many times so she could pay her school fees.

					The past few months have been a hassle. I have tried to wrestle myself and define my emotions - it's been frantic nights and hectic mornings.
					'There are years that ask questions and years that answer.'   -   Zora Neale Hurston.
					A quote from one of our favourite authors brought me to life.
					If only I could send the grief that I carry into a faraway space in my mind, I have tried to paint it in a different colour. If heartbreak truly had a sound, it will pop like crushed wrappers in my palms. I never knew I could feel pain so deep down, that it would touch my toes and the ceiling top.
					But alas; in the end, I am all of it - the grief, memories, and happiness.
					Adedoyinmi, I am blessed to have known you. Fate honoured me with 9 years of your beautiful spirit of sunny zest full of love. It was amazing to do life with you, weighing through the hopes, the rides and sails, the highs and lows, the academic struggles, the boy issues, the fears, the dreams, your obsession with Riri, your gleeful reactions with your write-ups, the cruise and banters.
					Abidemi, my heart swells to know that you lived well. I am elated for the great bonds and the hearts you touched in the years that Earth was blessed with your presence. You lived like a tree with branches spread out like the vast sky. Daily, you offered solace to all souls; light or dark, bringing ease and peace. I reminisce about our last meeting in January, watching you pack is a scene that won't leave soon,  I am fulfilled to have lasted in your embrace.
					Azeezat, you were an ageless star. When things went left, you were more than a friend till they went back right. I remember falling in love with the little things about you, the sound of your cherry laughter evident even in your voice notes, the beautiful way your smile forms, the deep hollow in your cheeks, the elegant way you carry your frame, your absolute brilliant mind and the depth of your love.
					Jilly said I should pen a goodbye, but it's hard. I have taken the last breaths of grief with deep sighs, I would rather relive our memories.
					I love you with all the space my heart can carry omo Onitolo.
					Stay divine my angel.

					The traumatizing reality of your early entrance to eternity is still very difficult for me to embrace.
					Death snatched you of your breath and took away your existence that was endearing to the earth - _I guess it got jealous_ cause who wouldn't? You were not just a paragon of beauty, but an epitome of love and happiness.
					You are always in my heart; your smile, your laughter, your character, the sound of your voice, everything still replays in my head.
					From the hair of your head to the sole of your feet, such a wonderful creation you were. Shine on your light. I love you now and always. You live forever in my heart Unni♥

					Writing this is a lil saddening but I’m glad I’m doing this to serve as my tribute message to a dear one.
					Azeeza! my friend  ,my scholar ,most optimistic, soft spoken ,easy going , most contented and a vibe even when things aren’t right she manages to light up the room, we barely spend time together but the lil times does count, Because they’re our little treasured memories which is wrapped up in a place of love and kept until we meet again🥺
					The last text I got from Zee was how we school in the same state but never had a time together, only if I (we) had known to make time out of no time, you left too early zee but I know you’re in the most peaceful & beautiful place. The last sentence she made to me is that “we still be forever friends” and that’s VALID!!  your friendship was a blessing and I’m glad we crossed path.
					
					Farewell my beloved, may Allah grant you eternal rest.

					My dear Azeezat, my friend and Unni, it is so crazy how I still feel your presence like you’re always somewhere around me when I know you’re not. I still pick up my phone sometimes to send funny memes to you but then I remember that you’re no more. It is sad and sickening to know that we won’t be able to make calls and joke about random stuff anymore.
					I remember our secondary school memories, we didn’t start off as best friends initially but when we did, we became sisters forever. I remember how we would joke about me being the Sabuna (little girl group we created) queen and you the princess. I remember how we would come together to do assignments and work on projects given to us back then in secondary school. Both of us would stand in front of the classroom to mimic our teachers and the whole class would laugh.
					Fast forward to after secondary school when we had to face the almighty Jamb examinations, we wrote it three times. I remember how yourself, Ijeoma and I would go to CKC to read, I remember creating a WhatsApp group just for the three of us to be able to pray and brainstorm after reading. I remember how elated we were when we got the news of your admission into Unilorin.
					My dear friend, I am so sorry that all your dreams and aspirations were cut short, if anyone would have told me that I’d be writing a tribute to you this very day, I would have beaten the person up. I am sorry that this country failed you my love. I still get chills when I remember that you’re not here anymore.
					I miss you and I love you Azeezat, you are and will always be in my heart forever. This is not a good bye, it is see you later. Until we meet again, happy posthumous birthday baby, may your soul continue to rest in perfect peace 🙏 Amen.</p>

					It’s difficult to accept, yet very true. I’m yet to understand the fact that you are gone. Your death came as a shock, the least thing I ever imagined could happen to a SWEET ONE like you. You are one of those I Cherish. You are everything, the word perfect is an understatement, to know you is to know PEACE and that’s why you will forever be in my heart and I will forever be a FAN. It’s a long time thing my guy, i see you everytime next to me having a tête-à-tête . Sadly, I can’t touch or hug you. We will meet someday in a better place..Definitely!

	<h4>FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS</h4>
</footer>

		
Every time I think about you , I hold my tears hardly and my throat keep hurting me ..
Those who touch our lives stay in our hearts forever 
How lucky  I am to have known you as my beautiful friend it's very hard for me saying goodbye
You will Always be in my heart and you also always be on my mind, forever in my head that I have lost a Gem 
You’ll be with me forever tho you are 
Gone but not yet forgotten
May the winds of heaven blow softly and whisper in your ear
How much we love and miss you and wish that you were here
You may be gone from my sight but you are never gone from my heart
Death leaves a heartache no one can heal
Love leaves a memory no one can steal
Your life was a blessing, your memory was  a treasure
You are loved beyond words and missed beyond measure
I will hold you in my heart until I can hold you again in paradise. azeezat I will miss you 😭😭😭😭😭😭.              PC @jojo the ijebu boy#
